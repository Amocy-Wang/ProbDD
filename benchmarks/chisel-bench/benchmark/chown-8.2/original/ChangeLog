	version 8.2
	* NEWS: Record release date.

	tests: use a slightly better CU_TEST_NAME setting
	* tests/check.mk (CU_TEST_NAME): Better test names.

	tail: don't call fstat on an uninitialized FD
	This bug showed up via valgrind as a "Conditional jump or move
	depends on uninitialized value(s)" error.
	* src/tail.c (ignore_fifo_and_pipe): New function.
	(main): Use it only when tailing forever.
	The code to compute n_viable and mark some F[i] as ignored would call
	isapipe on an uninitialized file descriptor.  But n_viable and those
	.ignored marks are useful/used only when tailing forever.  This bug
	was introduced via commit f0ff8c73 (7.6), "tail: make the new
	piped-stdin test as portable as the old one".
	* NEWS (Bug fixes): Mention it.

	doc: NEWS: mention that gnulib's mgetgroups fix affects id
	* NEWS (Bug fixes): Mention the "id" bug fix inherited via this gnulib
	change: "mgetgroups: do not write bytes beyond end of malloc'd buffer"

	doc: NEWS: the "make distcheck" vulnerability dates back to 5.0
	* NEWS (Bug fixes): Correct the introduced-in version number.
	This was introduced on 2003-04-02 by commit 722a49ea.

	doc: NEWS: mention the "make distcheck" vulnerability
	* NEWS (Bug fixes): Mention implications of the "make distcheck" change.
	This was introduced on 2008-07-22 by commit 9bb0d576, "tests: ensure
	"make check" w/tainted build dir no longer impacts $HOME".

	tests: don't let "umask 077" cause root-only cp/preserve-gid failure
	* tests/cp/preserve-gid: Use working_umask_or_skip_ to set umask to 022.

	maint: remove an erroneous comment
	* tests/misc/timeout: Remove an erroneous comment
	introduced through copy and paste.

	sort: fix failure if sort's parent has ignored SIGCHLD
	* src/sort.c (main): Reset the SIGCHLD handler to the default
	as otherwise wait() could return an error.
	* tests/misc/sort-compress: Set the CHLD handler in a subshell
	to SIG_IGN to ensure the sort command resets it to SIG_DFL.
	* NEWS: Mention the fix.

	timeout: fix failure if timeout's parent has ignored SIGCHLD
	* src/timeout.c (main): Reset the SIGCHLD handler to the default
	as otherwise wait() could return -1 and set errno to ECHILD.
	This condition was ignored until commit 0b1dcf33, on 31-08-2009,
	"timeout: defensive handling of all wait() errors"
	but subsequently timeout would run the command correctly
	but then fail with an error message.
	* tests/misc/timeout: In a subshell set the CHLD handler to
	SIG_IGN to ensure the timeout command resets it to SIG_DFL.
	* NEWS: Mention the fix.

	tests: fix stty-row-col failure on small fixed terminals
	* tests/misc/stty-row-col: Linux virtual consoles at least,
	issue an error if you try to increase their size, so skip the
	test if we can't increase the dimensions of the tty by 1 cell.
	Reported by Matthew Burgess.

	tests: fix stty failure with serial control settings
	* tests/misc/stty: Don't check the serial control settings as
	these are ignored by various Linux kernels.
	Reported by Matthew Burgess.

	build: update gnulib submodule to latest

	build: distcheck: do not leave a $TMPDIR/coreutils directory behind
	* dist-check.mk (tmpdir): Rename from TMPDIR.  Use ./tests/torture
	unconditionally, rather than $TMPDIR-with-default-to-/tmp.
	Otherwise, running "make distcheck" could leave an empty /tmp/coreutils
	directory behind.
	(tp): Simplify, now that it's always in the build-dir.
	(taint-distcheck): Set HOME earlier, in case $(MAKE) misbehaves.
	(my-instcheck, coreutils-path-check): Add diagnostics, so it's easier
	to diagnose when each runs.
	(coreutils-path-check): Run configure with --quiet, to reduce output.
	Inspired by Ralf Wildenhues' report of /tmp/coreutils being left behind.

2009-12-06  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	tests: readdir-mountpoint-inode avoid false-positive w/virtualbox
	* tests/ls/readdir-mountpoint-inode: With some systems, stat can
	succeed on a mount point and report that the inode number is 0.
	Since ls displays "?" for those, that would otherwise show up as a
	difference.  Skip such mount points.  Reported by Sergei Steshenko
	in http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.gnu.coreutils.bugs/19142

2009-12-06  Pádraig Brady  <P@draigBrady.com>

	tests: don't run tail-2/inotify-race by default
	* tests/tail-2/inotify-race: Note the caveats of the test.
	I.E. the intermittent skips and the gdb hang reported
	by Alan Curry.  Add extra info to the log on why the test
	is skipped as it may be due to multiple reasons.  Mark
	the test as very expensive so that it's not normally run.

	id: handle systems without getgroups support
	If getgroups failed with ENOSYS, mgetgroups would unnecessarily
	fail, and that provoked id into freeing an uninitialized pointer.
	Meanwhile, we were not using xalloc_die properly.  Both issues
	are better solved in gnulib, by introducing xgetgroups; this
	patch uses the new interface.

	Regression introduced by commit 6a31fd8d7.

	* gnulib: Update, for mgetgroups improvments.
	* src/id.c (print_full_info): Adjust caller to die on allocation
	failure, and no longer worry about ENOSYS.
	* src/group-list.c (print_group_list): Likewise.
	* src/setuidgid.c (main): Likewise.
	* NEWS: Mention the fix.
	* THANKS: Update.
	Reported by Scott Harrison.

2009-12-03  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	tests: fix a bug in sanitize_path_ that inhibited verbose output
	* tests/test-lib.sh (sanitize_path_): Use "set -- ...", not "set - ...",
	since the latter turns off the -x setting we rely on for VERBOSE=yes
	output.

2009-12-01  Eric Blake  <ebb9@byu.net>

	sort: fix link failure on Solaris
	Commit f9d0bb8481 made sort depend on xnanosleep.

	* src/Makefile.am (sort_LDADD): Add LIB_NANOSLEEP.

	rm: fix empty-name bug introduced with conversion to use fts
	While "rm ''" would properly fail, "rm F1 '' F2" would fail
	to remove F1 and F2, due to the empty string argument.
	This bug was introduced on 2009-07-12, via commit 4f73ecaf,
	"rm: rewrite to use fts".
	* gnulib: Update to latest, for fixed fts.c.
	* NEWS (Bug fixes): Describe it.
	* tests/rm/empty-name: Adjust for changed diagnostic.
	(mk_file): Define, copied from misc/ls-misc.
	(empty-name-2): New test, for today's fix.
	* lib/xfts.c (xfts_open): Reflect the change in fts_open, now that
	it no longer fails immediately when one argument is the empty string.
	Assert that the bit flags were not the cause of failure.
	* po/POTFILES.in: Remove xfts.c.
	* THANKS: Update.
	Reported by Ladislav Hagara.

	bootstrap: fix handling of various perl --version formats
	* bootstrap (get_version): Don't use perl's $] special
	variable, as that requires updating all bootstrap.conf files to
	use perl's x.yyyzzz version format.  Instead make the regular
	expression more general to support version formats from older
	perl-5.005_002 (5.5.2) and perl-5.11 which has other numbers
	in the version line.

2009-11-29  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	bootstrap: update from gnulib, for perl-5.11.x support
	* bootstrap (get_version): Handle perl separately,
	since perl-5.11's --version output is different.

	build: update gnulib submodule to latest

2009-11-28  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	maint: chown.c: remove a comment
	* src/chown.c: Remove old spec-like comment.

2009-11-24  Eric Blake  <ebb9@byu.net>

	tests: fix link failure on cygwin
	Counterpart to commit 8fe40b84bd8, since test-link.c uses rename,
	and we override gnulib with a rename() replacement that can xalloc_die.

	* gl/modules/link-tests.diff: New file.

	build: fix link failure on cygwin
	Cygwin 1.5 has a broken sleep, and the gnulib tests dragged in
	rpl_sleep which then caused a link failure because it wasn't in
	libcoreutils.a.  We could solve it by using the gnulib sleep module.
	However, sleep and usleep may interact poorly with SIGALRM, and they
	have less granularity; so it is better to adopt a policy that if we
	must sleep, prefer xnanosleep.

	* src/sort.c (pipe_fork): Use xnanosleep, to avoid the need for
	rpl_sleep on cygwin, and to reduce granularity.
	(MAX_FORK_TRIES_COMPRESS, MAX_FORK_TRIES_DECOMPRESS): Increase,
	to account for reduction in granularity.
	* src/tail.c (tail_file): Use xnanosleep in debug code.
	* cfg.mk (sc_prohibit_sleep): New rule.

2009-11-23  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	tests: avoid test failures when PATH contains an unsearchable directory
	* tests/test-lib.sh (sanitize_path_): New function.
	Always call it.

	tests: do not fail on read-only root file system
	* tests/touch/not-owner: Handle the case when the root file system is

	maint: cfg.mk: remove factored-out ftp host/dir definitions
	* cfg.mk (gnu_ftp_host-alpha, gnu_ftp_host-beta gnu_ftp_host-stable):
	(gnu_rel_host, url_dir_list): Remove definitions.  The defaults,
	now provided by maint.mk, are the same.
	* gnulib: Update for latest, including those maint.mk additions.

	maint: correct comments in test scripts
	* tests/misc/pwd-long: Fix spelling of cygwin1.dll in comment.
	* tests/rm/fail-eperm: Likewise.
	Reported by Eric Blake.

	maint: don't list "warnings" module explicitly
	* bootstrap.conf (gnulib_modules): Remove "warnings", now that
	it's pulled in automatically via "manywarnings".

	maint: move xfreopen module to gnulib
	* gl/lib/xfreopen.c: Remove file.
	* gl/lib/xfreopen.h: Likewise.
	* gl/modules/xfreopen: Likewise.

	build: update gnulib submodule to latest

2009-11-19  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	tests: avoid spurious failures due to insecure directory in PATH
	These tests perform no PATH search, and used to simply delete PATH from
	the environment.  However, that is not portable, as seen on Cygwin,
	where cygwin.dll must be resolvable via PATH when starting a sub-shell.
	With commit 0cc04241, we took the alternate approach of untainting the
	incoming $ENV{PATH}, but that fails when it contains an other-writable
	directory.  Instead, now we hard code it to '/bin:/usr/bin'.

	* tests/misc/pwd-long: Hard code $ENV{PATH} to a safe value.
	* tests/rm/fail-eperm: Likewise.
	Reported by Gilles Espinasse, Andreas Schwab, and Bauke Jan Douma.

	true, false: perform initialization only when argc == 2
	* src/true.c (main): There is no reason to examine argv[0],
	call atexit, etc., in the usual case in which we're about to exit.
	This has the side effect of making it so that these programs
	no longer segfault when subjected to execve abuse.
	Before this change, these commands would make "true" segfault:
	  printf '%s\n' '#include <unistd.h>' 'int main(int c, char**v)' \
	    '{ execve (v[1], 0, 0); }' > k.c && gcc k.c && ./a.out $PWD/true
	Now it succeeds.  Reported by Tetsuo Handa and Bart Van Assche
	via Ondřej Vašík in http://bugzilla.redhat.com/537684.

	tail -F can fail to track a file after it's been rotated
	Tailing forever and by-name (--follow=name, -F), tail would
	sometimes fail to follow a file that had been removed via rename.
	If you can't apply this patch and have tail 7.6 or newer, you can
	work around the bug via the undocumented --disable-inotify option.
	* src/tail.c (tail_forever_inotify): When tailing by name (-F),
	do not un-watch a file upon receipt of the IN_MOVE_SELF event.

	ls: fix capability coloring
	Capability checking was incorrectly done on just the base name
	rather than on the whole path.  Consequently there could be both
	false positives and negatives when coloring files with capabilities.
	Also capability checking was not done at all in certain cases for
	non executable files.  Note passing absolute rather than relative
	names to cap_get_file() reduces the has_capability() overhead
	from around 33% to 30%.  I.E. ls --color is now around 3% faster.

	* src/ls.c (struct fileinfo): Add a has_capability member.
	(print_color_indicator): Refactor to pass just a fileinfo pointer
	and a flag to say if we're dealing with a symlink target.
	(print_name_with_quoting): Likewise.
	(gobble_file): Set has_capability in the fileinfo struct.  Also do
	a capability check even if executable coloring is disabled.

	build: consistently use freopen-safer
	cat, head, ptx, shuf, tac, tail, tee, tr, and uniq used freopen
	on stdout, and were potentially vulnerable.  dircolors, du, and

	build: reflect gnulib changes to tempname
	In glibc 2.11 and gnulib, gen_tempname added a parameter

	* src/mktemp.c (mkstemp_len, mkdtemp_len): Update callers.

	build: override gnulib tempname via diff
	Diffs are more robust than wholesale replacement, because bootstrap

	tests: rm: add test for today's change in behavior
	* tests/Makefile.am (root_tests): Add rm/read-only to the list.
	* tests/rm/read-only: New file.

	rm -f: ignore EROFS when it's really ENOENT
	rm -f must not print a diagnostic for a nonexistent file.  However,
	most linux-based kernel unlinkat functions set errno to EROFS when
	the named file (regardless of whether it exists) would lie on a
	read-only file system.  remove.c now performs an extra fstatat call
	in that case, to determine whether the file exists.
	* src/remove.c (excise): Map EROFS to ENOENT, if a file is nonexistent.
	Reported by Steven Drake in <http://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?27923>.

	nice, nohup, su: detect write failure to stderr
	These programs can print non-fatal diagnostics to stderr prior to
	exec'ing a subsidiary program.  However, if we thought the situation
	warranted a diagnostic, we insist that the diagnostic be printed
	without error, rather than blindly exec, as it may be a security risk.

	For an example, try 'nice -n -1 nice 2>/dev/full'.  Failure to raise
	priority (by lowering niceness) is not fatal, but failure to inform
	the user about failure to change priority is dangerous.

	to stderr fails.

	* tests/misc/env: Further tweaks, avoiding PATH problems inherent

	build: don't let environment settings perturb build
	Setting the envvars, LIB_FDATASYNC, LIB_XATTR or LIB_CRYPT
	could cause a configure-time and/or build-time malfunction.
	Typically, a configure-time function-in-library test is performed
	via code like this:

	  LIB_VAR=
	  AC_SUBST([LIB_VAR])
	  prefix_saved_LIBS=$LIBS
	    AC_SEARCH_LIBS([FUNC], [LIB_NAME],
	                   [test "$ac_cv_search_FUNC" = "none required" ||
	                    LIB_VAR=$ac_cv_search_FUNC])
	  LIBS=$prefix_saved_LIBS

	However, in each of the files affected by this change, the LIB_VAR=
	initialization was omitted.  Thus, when set in the environment, its
	value would propagate into generated Makefiles when FUNC is not found
	in LIB_NAME.
	* m4/jm-macros.m4 (coreutils_MACROS): Initialize AC_SUBST'd var
	* m4/lib-check.m4 (cu_LIB_CHECK): Likewise.

	chcon: don't disable just because SELinux is disabled
	* src/chcon.c (main): Now that gnulib provides getfilecon wrappers,
	we can revert most of the 2009-10-05 commit 3a97d664, "chcon: exit
	immediately if SELinux is disabled", since chcon is still useful as
	long as the file system provides handlers for the security.*
	name space.  gnulib's getfilecon wrappers ensure that an offending
	context now evokes a return value of -1.

	chcon: exit immediately if SELinux is disabled
	This change happens to avoid an abort in chcon when SELinux is
	disabled while operating on a file with an "unlabeled" context from
	back in 2006.  However, that same abort can still be triggered by the
	same file when running chcon with SELinux enabled.  This bug in chcon
	will be fixed in a subsequent commit via a getfilecon wrapper.  See

	tail: avoid a race where we could miss new data with --pid
	* src/tail.c (tail_forever, tail_forever_inotify): Close a race in
	tail_forever_inotify where new data written after the file check by
	a now dead process, but before the pid check, is not output.  We use
	the POSIX guarantee that read() and write() are serialized wrt each
	other even in separate processes, to assume full file consistency
	after exit() and so poll for new data _after_ the writer has exited.
	This also allows us to not redundantly _wait_ for new data if the
	process is dead.
	* tests/tail-2/pid: Remove the now partially invalid sub second sleep
	check as we now don't unconditionally wait, and replace it with a check
	for the redundant sleep.  Also clarify some of the existing comments.
	* NEWS: Mention the fix.

	than 1 second.  A 1-second timeout could be too short on a very busy

	long listings properly printed "?" when the inode was unknown,
	but the code for handling short listings would print 0 instead.

	ls -i: print consistent inode numbers also for mount points
	On most unix- and linux-based kernels, ls -i DIR_CONTAINING_MOUNT_POINT
	would print the wrong inode number for any entry that is a mount point.
	It would do that by relying on readdir's dirent.d_ino values, while
	most readdir implementations return the inode number of the underlying,
	inaccessible directory.  Thus, it is not consistent with what you'd
	get when applying stat to the same entry.  This bug led to surprising
	results like "ls -i" and "ls -i --color" printing different numbers (ls
	must usually "stat" a file to colorize its name).  This change makes it
	so that on offending systems, ls must stat non-command-line-arguments
	for which otherwise it would be able to use "for free" dirent.d_ino
	values.  Regardless of this change, ls is already required to stat every
	command-line argument.  Note: versions of GNU ls prior to coreutils-6.0
	did not perform the invalid optimization, and hence always printed
	correct inode numbers.  Thus, for the sake of correctness, ls -i is
	forgoing the readdir optimization, for any kernel (including linux!)
	with POSIX-nonconforming readdir.  Note that currently, only Cygwin has
	been agile enough to conform.

	* src/ls.c (RELIABLE_D_INO): Define.
	(print_dir): Use it.
	For plenty of discussion, see this long thread:

	chroot: don't set bogus user-ID or group-ID for --u=U: or --u=:G

	mv, rm: adapt to new and improved gnulib interfaces
	Use gnulib's new priv-set module and updated write-any-file.
	With them, the remove-called can_write_any_file function no

	(sc_tight_scope): Use $(AM_V_GEN) here, too.
	* gnulib: Update submodule to latest, for the proper_name_utf8 fix
	that makes --version output print the UTF-8 rendering of author names
	in more cases.

	so that a failing "make check" explains that Perl is not installed.
	Reported by James Youngman.

	build: doc: emit something for each "make check"-run rule

	cp: work around linux kernel bug: short-read != EOF on /proc
	Remove the optimization that avoided up to 50% of cp's read syscalls.
	Do not assume that a short read on a regular file indicates EOF.
	When reading from a file in /proc on linux [at least 2.6.9 - 2.6.29]
	into a 4k-byte buffer or larger, a short read does not
	always indicate EOF.  For example, "cp /proc/slabinfo /tmp"
	copies only 4068 of the total 7493 bytes.  This optimization
	(25719a33154f0c62ea9881f0c79ae312dd4cec7a, Improve performance a bit
	by optimizing away; 2005-11-24) appears to have been worth less than
	a 2% speed-up (and usually much less), so the impact of removing it
	is negligible.

	* src/copy.c (copy_reg): Don't exit the loop early.
	* tests/cp/proc-short-read: New test, lightly based on a suggestion
	from Mike Frysinger, to exercise this fix.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add cp/proc-short-read.
	* NEWS (Improve robustness): Mention this change.

	tests: avoid new "make distcheck" failure due to newer File::Temp
	With newer perl (e.g., Fedora 10's 4:5.10.0-68.fc10), tests/CuTmpdir.pm
	stopped removing its temporary directories, with diagnostics like this:
	  cannot remove path when cwd is /c/coreutils/tests/misc/seq.tmp-e2up \
	  for /c/coreutils/tests/misc/seq.tmp-e2up: at \
	  /usr/lib/perl5/5.10.0/File/Temp.pm line 902
	Chdir out of the target directory before that code runs:
	* tests/CuTmpdir.pm (END): chdir '..'.
	(chmod_tree): Remove explicit "chdir $dir".

	ls: fix alignment when month names have varying widths
	Reported by Samuel Thibault and Stéphane Raimbault, as the glibc fr_FR
	locale has recently changed to use the official but variable width
	abbreviated month names. Other glibc locales also have variable widths.
	http://sourceware.org/ml/libc-locales/2008-q1/msg00035.html
	http://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=9859
	* NEWS: Mention the fix
	* gl/lib/mbsalign.c: A new module to align and truncate a
	string in a specified number of screen cells, while handling
	multi-byte characters appropriately.
	* gl/lib/mbsalign.h: Ditto
	* gl/modules/mbsalign: Ditto
	* bootstrap.conf: Reference the new module
	* src/ls.c (abmon_init): New function, precompute the abbreviated
	months aligned left in a minimum width column <= 5 screen cells.
	(align_nstrftime): New function, replace the first %b in the
	format specification to strftime with the precomputed month string.
	Note using the cached month strings speeds up `ls -lU` by around 17%
	on glibc-2.7-2 on linux at least.  Also if we implement this function
	using heap storage rather than automatic storage, and use snprintf
	instead of strcpy, ls will slow down by 2% and 1% respectively
	(i.e. a net gain of 14% rather than 17%).
	* tests/ls/abmon-align: A new test to test ls alignment for
	various formats and locales

	tests: add another sort/nmerge test
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add sort-merge-fdlimit.
	* tests/misc/sort-merge-fdlimit: New file.
	* doc/coreutils.texi (sort invocation): Document that we now silently
	lower nmerge if necessary.
	Patch by Paul Eggert, Nima Nikzad, Max Chang, Alexander Nguyen,
	Sahil Amoli, and Nick Graham.

	sort: handle fd exhaustion better when merging
	This is an alternative to my 9 March patch labeled "Silently lower
	nmerge; don't (sometimes incorrectly) range-check"
	<http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-coreutils/2009-03/msg00070.html>.
	It differs by not using 'dup' to probe for extra file descriptors;
	instead, it simply calls 'open' (and 'pipe') to open files and pipes,
	until one of these calls fails due to file descriptor exhaustion; it
	then backs off by 1, does a merge with the files that it has opened,
	and then retries with the (now-smaller) number of files.

	This patch requires quite a few more changes to the source code than
	the earlier patch, but it is in some sense "better" because it doesn't
	need to call "dup" ahead of time in order to decide whether "open" or
	"pipe" will fail.  Also, it's more robust in the case where "open" or
	"pipe" fails with errno==EMFILE because some system-wide limit is
	exhausted.

	* src/sort.c (create_temp_file): New arg SURVIVE_FD_EXHAUSTION.
	(stream_open): New function, containing guts of xfopen.
	(xfopen): Use it.
	(pipe_fork): Set errno on failure.
	(maybe_create_temp): New function, containing guts of create_temp.
	(create_temp): Use it.
	(open_temp): Distinguish failures due to file descriptor exhaustion
	from other failures, and on fd exhaustion return a notice to caller
	rather than dying.  Don't test execlp's return value; when it returns,
	it *always* returns -1.
	(open_input_files): New function.
	(mergefps): New arg FPS. It's now the caller's responsibility to open
	the input and output files.  All callers changed.
	(mergefiles): New function.
	(avoid_trashing_input, merge): Handle the case where a single merge
	can't merge as much as we wanted due to file descriptor exhaustion, by
	merging as much as we can and then retrying.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add misc/sort-continue.
	* tests/misc/sort-continue: New file.
	* THANKS: Add Glen Lenker and Matt Pham who coauthored this patch.

	* HACKING: avoid trailing white space

	cp: diagnose invalid "cp -rl dir dir" right away, once again
	Running "mkdir dir; cp -rl dir dir" would create dir/dir/dir/...
	rather than diagnosing the "copy-into-self" failure.

	The easy fix would have been to revert this part of the change
	[3ece0355 2008-11-09 cp: use far less memory in some cases]
	that introduced the bug:

	-         remember_copied (dst_name, dst_sb.st_ino, dst_sb.st_dev);
	+         if (!x->hard_link)
	+           remember_copied (dst_name, dst_sb.st_ino, dst_sb.st_dev);

	However, that would have induced the failure of the new cp/link-heap
	test, due to the added memory pressure of recording 10k dev/ino pairs.
	And besides, I liked that improvement and wanted to keep it.

	Now that it's obvious recording the just-created-directory dev/ino
	needn't depend on the setting of hard_link, I realized it is necessary
	to record the pair only for the first directory created for each
	source command-line argument.

	I made that change, then noticed the new test, cp -rl a d d, would pass
	when run once, yet output the into-self diagnostic twice.  Also note
	the side effect: it creates d/a and d/d.  However, running that same
	command a second time, now with the modified directory, would fail.

	That turned out to be due to the fact that although the first into-self
	failure was detected in copy_dir, that function would continue copying
	other entries regardless -- and that would make it fail (eventually)
	with the unwanted recursion.

	* src/copy.c (copy_internal): This function needed an indicator of
	whether, for a give command line argument, it had already created its
	first directory.  If so, no more need to record dev/ino pairs.  If this
	is the first, then do record its pair.  Hence, the new parameter.
	(copy_dir, copy): Update callers.
	(copy_dir): Upon any into-self failure, break out of the loop.
	* tests/cp/into-self: Test for the above.

	ls: clean up after wrapped+colored file names with clear-to-EOL
	This change addresses a relatively unusual case: ls --color, with
	a highlighted name being printed initially in the last row of a
	terminal emulator (possibly followed by other lines of output) such
	that it is wrapped onto the following line, as the terminal emulator
	scrolls the output.  That would cause the entire following line to
	be highlighted, even if the name happened to use only one position.
	The least-invasive patch would have made colorized output larger for
	all uses.  The approach taken below is more invasive, but limits the
	increase in overhead to only those lines that are expected to wrap.
	* src/ls.c (enum indicator_no): Add C_CLR_TO_EOL.
	(indicator_name): Add "cl".
	(color_indicator): Add default escape codes for "cl".
	(print_long_format): Propagate width to print_name_with_quoting.
	(print_name_with_quoting): Print new C_CLR_TO_EOL string if needed.
	Return the width of what we're printing.
	(print_file_name_and_frills): Propagate width.
	(print_type_indicator): Return bool (aka width).
	(print_many_per_line): Pass column position to print_* function.
	(print_current_files): Likewise.
	(print_horizontal): Likewise.
	(print_with_commas): Likewise.
	* src/dircolors.c (slack_codes): Add "CLRTOEOL".
	(ls_codes): Add "cl".
	* tests/ls/color-clear-to-eol: New file.  Test for this fix.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add ls/color-clear-to-eol.
	* THANKS: Update.
	Reported by Alexander V. Lukyanov.  See thread for details:
	http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/740021/focus=14824
	Thanks to Jan Engelhardt for helping me reproduce the problem.

	Demonstrate with this in an 80-column xterm:
	  seq 200 # to start in the "bottom" row
	  touch zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.foo
	  env LS_COLORS='*.foo=0;31;42' ls -og --color=always

	Before the fix, you'd see something like this:
	(where the file name is printed in red on a green background,
	and each "=" denotes a space on a green background)
	...
	  -rw-r--r--  1       0 Feb  5 11:31 zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz\
	  zzzzzzzzzzzzzz.foo===================================================

	conversion), use two-buffer mode only when the input and output
	buffer sizes differ.  Before, some of the most basic invocations of

2008-11-20  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	cp: use far less memory in some cases
	cp --link was "remembering" many name,dev,inode triples unnecessarily.

	command-line arguments.  Prompted by a report from Patrick Shoenfeld.
	Details <http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.gnu.coreutils.bugs/15081>.
	* src/copy.c (copy_internal): Refrain from remembering
	name,dev,inode for most files, when invoked via cp --link.

	seq: improve quality of format-checking code
	* src/seq.c (validate_format): Remove. Migrate its checks into...
	(long_double_format): Report an error and exit if an error is found,
	instead of returning NULL.  All callers changed.
	Use a more-consistent format for diagnostics.
	* tests/misc/seq: Adjust to the more-consistent format for diagnostics.

	factor: avoid compilation failure without libgmp
	* src/factor.c (debug) [!HAVE_GMP]: Define.
	Reported by Bob Proulx.

2008-10-25  Paul Eggert  <eggert@CS.UCLA.EDU>

	factor: remove --bignum and --no-bignum options
	Here's a patch to remove the --bignum and --no-bignum options from
	'factor'.  The case for removing --bignum isn't as strong as that for
	'expr', but still, it seems to me that these options are not needed and
	complicate the documentation unnecessarily.

	* doc/coreutils.texi (factor invocation): Remove --bignum, --no-bignum.
	* src/factor.c (algorithm, ALGORITHM_CHOICE, USE_BIGNUM, NO_USE_BIGNUM):
	Remove; all uses removed.
	(extract_factors_multi): Remove, replacing with....
	(print_factors_multi): New function, with signature similar to that
	of new signature of print_factors_single.
	(print_factors_single): Migrate checking code to caller.
	(print_factors): Use GMP if it's available; don't bother asking user.
	Improve accuracy of check for "large" numbers.
	(long_options, main): Remove support for --bignum.

2008-10-25  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	tests: df/total: don't fail for an inaccessible mount point

2008-10-25  Paul Eggert  <eggert@CS.UCLA.EDU>

	seq: revert Solaris 8 work-around that caused x86 regression
	* src/seq.c: Don't include <math.h>, <float.h>.
	(abs_rel_diff): Remove.
	(print_numbers): Test for equality, not for an epsilonish value.
	This reverts 4827dd27b0c655a685947aaa01426a5ecba179f3, aka
	v6.10-185-g4827dd2, which broke 'seq' on the x86; for example, it
	causes "seq 9223372036854775807 9223372036854775808" to incorrectly
	output 3 numbers instead of 2.  It's better to punish obsolescent
	hosts that have incorrectly-working floating-point than to punish
	correctly-working hosts.
	* tests/misc/seq: Use 0.9000000000000, rather than
	0.90000000000000000000, to avoid tickling a bug in Solaris 8 strtold,
	which converts "0.9" and "0.9000000000000" correctly, but incorrectly
	converts "0.90000000000000000000" to a smaller value.

2008-10-24  Eric Blake  <ebb9@byu.net>

	group-list: avoid compiler warning

	ls: use '.' (not +) as SELinux-only alt. access flag in ls -l output
	* src/ls.c (gobble_file) [long_format]: Map SELinux-only to '.',
	any other nonempty combination of MAC and ACL to '+', and all else
	to the usual ' '.  Suggested by Michael Stone.
	* tests/misc/selinux: Adapt: expect '.', not '+'.
	* doc/coreutils.texi (What information is listed): Document this.
	* NEWS (Changes in behavior): Mention it.

2008-10-22  Pádraig Brady  <P@draigBrady.com>

	Remove lzma as a specific build requirement
	* bootstrap.conf: lzma was added as a build requirement
	in the recently added build tools requirements check.
	Remove that as it's quite new and also only required
	for the make dist stage.

2008-10-22  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/ls.c (usage): Describe exit statuses more concisely.

2008-10-22  Pádraig Brady  <P@draigBrady.com>

	Add better checks and docs for build tools
	Prompted by a report from Ed Avis:
	<http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.gnu.coreutils.bugs/14710>

	* README-hacking: Organise LZMA and Valgrind as
	as optional requirements rather than in their own sections.
	Mention bootstrap will now check tool versions.
	* README-prereq: Make a start on specific instructions
	for optaining build tools. Currently we just have notes
	for Fedora linux.
	* bootstrap.conf: Add the list of tools and versions required.
	* bootstrap: Add the logic to check for the required tools,
	and list all required tools and versions if any are missing.

2008-10-22  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	clean up gl/modules/selinux-at
	* gl/modules/selinux-at:
	Ensure that LIB_SELINUX is cleared, in case it's set in the environment.
	m4-quote the first two args to AC_SEARCH_LIBS.
	Don't violate autoconf's ac_ namespace: s/ac_save/gl_save/
	Drop the useless double quotes around a simple assignment RHS.

	Remove temporary file and target, in case they're read-only.
	Use $(MKDIR_P), not mkdir -p.
	(License): Relax to LGPLv2+.
	Remove vestigial comments.

	tests: test today's ls-vs-capability fix
	Test for this fix: f3f1ccfd871ee395e7fafc051c1b7dedb39fdfc9.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add ls/no-cap.
	* tests/ls/no-cap: New file.

2008-10-21  Kamil Dudka  <kdudka@redhat.com>

	ls: make it possible to disable file capabilities checking
	* ls.c (print_color_indicator): Do not check for file capability
	if that attribute is not being colored.
	Since 84f6abfe00b4ab533145623638b417a2221f9c75, ls --color would check
	each file for "capabilities".  In <http://bugzilla.redhat.com/467508>,
	James Antill reported that ls --color seemed slower with capabilities
	detection.

2008-10-21  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	* AUTHORS (expr): Add Paul Eggert.

2008-10-19  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	only if src/true.c exists.  Factored out of...
	(my-distcheck):  ...here.

2008-10-17  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	maint: avoid warning in ls.c
	* src/ls.c (has_capability) [!HAVE_CAP]: Add unused attribute.

	maint: avoid warnings due to attribute warn_unused_result
	Now that a (void) cast no longer suffices to ignore warnings from gcc
	about uses of functions marked with the warn_unused_result attribute,
	we need an alternative.  For the record, here's one of the ignorable
	warnings: "copy.c:233: warning: ignoring return value of 'fchown',
	declared with attribute warn_unused_result"
	* bootstrap.conf (gnulib_modules): Import ignore-value.
	* src/copy.c: Include "ignore-value.h".
	(set_owner): Use ignore_value in place of "(void)" casts,
	to ignore lchown and fchown failures.
	* src/cp.c (re_protect): Likewise, to ignore lchown failure.
	* src/remove.c (preprocess_dir): Remove unnecessary "(void)" cast.

2008-10-16  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	mktemp: diagnose freopen failure
	* src/mktemp [--quiet]: Don't ignore freopen failure.

2008-10-16  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/mktemp.c (main): Add 'const' twice to avoid GCC warning.

2008-10-16  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	build: when po-check fails, say why and suggest a fix
	* maint.mk (po-check): Before, when this check failed, it just
	spat out a diff mentioning two temporary files.  Now, it tells
	you what's wrong and suggests a fix with a patch using the name
	of the affected file (rather than temporary file names) in the
	diff output.

2008-10-16  Eric Blake  <ebb9@byu.net>

	csplit: prefer sigaction over signal
	* bootstrap.conf (gnulib_modules): Import sigaction.
	* src/csplit.c (sigprocmask, siginterrupt) [SA_NOCLDSTOP]: Delete
	workarounds.
	(interrupt_handler, main): Drop use of signal.  Rely on sigaction
	to block fatal signal during cleanup, and to restore it to default
	in case of nested signals.

2008-10-15  Pádraig Brady  <P@draigBrady.com>

	tests: add option processing tests for 'expr'
	* tests/misc/expr: Add tests for various combinations
	of options where the first part of the expression
	could be confused with an option.

2008-10-15  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	expr: remove --bignum and --no-bignum options
	* doc/coreutils.texi (expr invocation): Remove the --bignum and
	--no-bignum options.  They weren't really needed, and they broke
	longstanding (albeit nonportable) scripts.
	* src/expr.c: Don't include <assert.h>.  Include "inttostr.h",
	"long-options.h", "verify.h".  Check at compile-time that
	size_t fits in unsigned long int, as the code assumes this in
	several places.
	(HAVE_GMP): Define to 0 if not defined, for convenience.
	(mpz_t, mpz_clear, mpz_init_set_ui, mpz_init_set_str, mpz_add):
	(mpz_sub, mpz_mul, mpz_tdiv_q, mpz_tdiv_r, mpz_get_str, mpz_sgn):
	(mpz_fits_ulong_p, mpz_get_ui, mpz_out_str):
	Supply substitutes when !HAVE_GMP, which work well enough for
	expr's purposes.
	(mp_integer): Remove.  All integers are gmp, if gmp is available.
	(struct valinfo): Remove 'z' member; no longer needed.  The 'i'
	member is always of type mpz_t.
	(enum arithmetic_mode, MP_NEVER, MP_ALWAYS, MP_AUTO, mode):
	Remove; no longer needed.
	(usage): Remove documentation of --bignum and --no-bignum.
	(integer_overflow): Abort if error misbehaves, to pacify GCC.
	Restore old message on arithmetic overflow, to be conservative.
	(die): Omit exit_status parameter; not needed (is always EXPR_FAILURE).
	(string_too_long, USE_BIGNUM, NO_USE_BIGNUM, long_options):
	Remove; no longer needed.
	(main): Don't use getopt_long; this breaks old nonportable scripts.
	(int_value): Arg is unsigned, in case we have strings whose length
	exceeds LONG_MAX (!).
	(int_value, freev, printv, null, tostring, toarith):
	(eval6, eval4, eval3):
	Always use mpz_ functions, to simplify the code.
	(substr_value): Remove; no longer needed.
	(getsize): Simplify the API: one arg rather than 3.  Don't assume
	unsigned long int fits in size_t.
	(promote, domult, dodivide, doadd): Remove; no longer needed.
	* tests/misc/expr: Don't use --bignum to test for bignum support.
	Instead, use big numbers to test this.

2008-10-15  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	expr: don't interpret argv[0] as an operand
	* src/expr.c (main): Given a first argument like -22 (negative, with
	two or more digits), expr would decrement optind to 0 and then attempt
	to evaluate argv[0].

	doc: cp, mv: remove mention of deprecated --reply= option
	* doc/coreutils.texi (cp invocation, mv invocation): Don't mention it.

2008-10-13  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	doc: adjust spacing in ls --help output, for better man formatting
	* src/ls.c (usage): Adjust spacing so the "Exit status:" list

2008-10-13  Ondřej Vašík  <ovasik@redhat.com>

	doc: ls: clarify exit status description
	* src/ls.c (exit_status): Clarify comments.

	Reported by Greg Metcalfe in <http://bugzilla.redhat.com/446294>.

2008-10-12  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	doc: reorder tsort/ptx nodes so body and menu ordering are consistent
	* doc/coreutils.texi (tsort invocation, tsort background): Move these
	nodes "down", so that they follow the ptx nodes, thus matching the
	alphabetized order in the menu.
	(tsort background): Make this a subsection.
	Suggested by Karl Berry.

	tests: move check-misc targets from src/Makefile.am to maint.mk
	* src/Makefile.am (check): Remove check-misc.
	(check-misc): Remove target.
	* maint.mk (sc_prohibit_stat_st_blocks): New target.
	(sc_prohibit_S_IS_definition): New target.
	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Add .x-sc_prohibit_stat_st_blocks.
	* .x-sc_prohibit_stat_st_blocks: New file.
	Andreas Schwab reported that "make check" could fail to detect
	violation of the no-S_IS*-definition policy.

	tests: df: avoid test failure when using mawk
	* tests/df/total-awk: Rewrite to use $PERL, not $AWK.
	mawk can't even count above 2^31.  Reported by Ed Avis.
	http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.gnu.coreutils.bugs/14792/focus=14802
	* tests/df/total-verify: Rename from total-awk.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Reflect renaming.

	chcon: remove traces of unimplemented --change (-c) option
	This option was never supported in upstream coreutils.

	Remove related and now-unused enums.

2008-10-06  Andreas Dilger  <adilger@sun.com>

2008-10-04  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	tests: fix the install/strip-program test
	* tests/install/strip-program: Use $PREFERABLY_POSIX_SHELL,
	not POSIX_SHELL.  The latter may be empty, and would fail
	on OpenBSD 3.9.
	* tests/check.mk (TESTS_ENVIRONMENT): Propagate
	PREFERABLY_POSIX_SHELL to tests.

2008-10-03  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	timeout.c: don't use perror; exit 125 upon failed fork
	* src/timeout.c (main): Use "error", not perror.
	Elbert Pol noticed a build failure on OS/2.

2008-10-02  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	bootstrap: merge from gnulib
	* bootstrap: add submodule support, git-merge-changelog

2008-10-01  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	remove.c: combine two helper functions, to avoid sign-extension
	* src/remove.c (fs_handles_readdir_ordered_dirents_efficiently):
	Remove function, so as not to have to worry about the type of
	statfs.f_type and sign extension.
	(dirent_inode_sort_may_be_useful): Adjust comment.
	Perform the switch directly on the struct.member here, instead.
	Andreas Schwab spotted the potential for a sign-extension bug,
	that happens not to bite for the S_* f_type values currently used.

	rm: don't preprocess a directory on a file system of type tmpfs or nfs
	The preprocessing phase is not necessary on tmpfs, and induces
	a 20% performance decrease when removing a 2M-entry directory.
	* src/remove.c (fs_handles_readdir_ordered_dirents_efficiently):
	(dirent_inode_sort_may_be_useful): New functions from gnulib/fts.c.
	They'll probably become a gnulib module -- eventually.
	(preprocess_dir): Use dirent_inode_sort_may_be_useful.

	tests: use our new timeout program
	* tests/rm/ext3-perf: Also, record set-up duration and FS type.

	seq: solve e13188e7ef7bbd609c1586332a335b4194b881aa more cleanly
	* src/seq.c (print_numbers): Don't switch c_strtold -> strtold
	in order to accommodate the locale-dependent behavior of our internal

2008-09-27  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	rm -r: avoid O(n^2) performance for a directory with very many entries
	This enhancement works around a problem that is specific to at least
	ext3 and ext4 file systems.  With them, it would take hours to remove
	a two-million-entry directory.  RAM-backed file systems (tmpfs) are
	not affected, since there is no seek penalty.
	* remove.c (rm_malloc, rm_free, compare_ino): New functions.
	(dirent_count, preprocess_dir): New function.
	[struct readdir_data]: New struct.
	(remove_cwd_entries): Call preprocess_dir.
	* tests/rm/ext3-perf: New file.  Test for the performance fix.
	* NEWS: mention the new feature

	remove.c: don't use xmalloc; don't let obstack call exit on failure
	(obstack_chunk_alloc, obstack_chunk_free): Don't define.
	(top_dir): Param is no longer "const".
	Use malloc, not xmalloc, and call longjmp upon failed malloc.
	(obstack_init_minimal): New function.
	(ds_init): Don't use xmalloc.  Instead, use caller-supplied buffer.
	Use obstack_specify_allocation_with_arg, not obstack_init, so
	that we control what happens upon allocation failure.
	Arrange for ds_free not to free uninitialized if/when
	any obstack_specify_allocation_with_arg allocation fails.
	(ds_free): Don't free DS, now that it's no longer malloc'd.
	(rm): Allocate DS on the stack.
	Arrange to handle ds_init allocation failure.

	step1

	* maint.mk (my-distcheck): remove duplicate c99-related test code

	maint: allow more C99 constructs; stop maintaining c99-to-c89 patch set

	With the recent changes to remove.c, I no longer wish
	to maintain the c99-to-c89 patch set.

2008-09-26  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	seq -0.1 0.1 2: print final number when locale's decimal point is ","
	* src/seq.c (print_numbers): Use strtold, not c_strtold to convert

	And this did the rest, plus a few undesirable ones, so I manually

	(main): parse these options with getopt_long instead of

	truncate: handle the case in which off_t != intmax_t

	address root cause of compilation failures:
	The affected code wasn't even being compiled on my system,
	because HAVE_NL_LANGINFO was not defined.  On other systems, where

	* tests/misc/printf-surprise: Detect case of a low-memory-provoked
	segfault and skip the test (this is actually a bug in snprintf).

	Now each diagnoses both unusual cases.

	envvar-check, so that the few scripts that require $TMPDIR don't fail.
	This is also good to let a user's default TMPDIR setting be used e.g.,
	in the search for an 'other-partition'.
	FIXME: this is pretty ugly.  maybe undo it and find a better way.
	(TESTS_ENVIRONMENT): Invoke perl scripts with $(PERL), and use -T
	if the script requires that.  Otherwise, use $(SHELL).

	subdirectory, adjust the full name of the "rm" program we're going
	to run.

	Change #!/bin/sh to #!/usr/bin/perl, and factor out the few lines
	of boilerplate code to invoke perl.  Do not "require 5.00x";

	tests: allow to run Perl tests more cleanly
	Before this change, perl tests were run via a #!/bin/sh script

	Before, this test and others would pass with empty $built_programs.
	* tests/misc/help-version: Fail if built_programs is empty.

	tests: improve perl-based tempdir handling
	Before, upon interrupt, directories would be left behind.
	* tests/CuTmpdir.pm: Remove temporary directory on interrupt.

	tests: reorder some tests in the long list
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Move some tests that use sleep
	"up" in the list so that they don't delay even a little the
	completion of "make check".  Also run a chmod test early.

	tests: put root-only (usually skipped) tests at the end
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Don't list root-only tests explicitly.
	Instead, just use $(root_tests).

	This test was run only when RUN_VERY_EXPENSIVE_TESTS=yes was set
	in the environment.  It would fail on SELinux-enable systems
	because ls-generated permission strings would not match, e.g.,
	"test _-rw-r--r--+ = _-rw-r--r--" would fail.

	id: do print the AFS-specific nameless group ID (called a PAG)
	In 6.11, we mistakenly suppressed the printing of certain group IDs,
	thinking they were useless AFS-specific artifacts.
	This change reverts that, so now they are printed once again.
	http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.org.fsf.announce/867/focus=13345
	This also reverts the bug-fix that applied solely to the new code
	used to avoid printing those IDs

	Revert "id bug fix: don't point to potentially clobbered static storage"
	This reverts commit f7d1c59c224f81a8bab5fa2afcaf815988f50467.
	Revert "Work around AFS bug: id and groups would print invalid group number."
	This reverts commit b7a836c0a3524cda8ef79c30c3fe7ea759ae4656.
	Revert "* src/c99-to-c89.diff: Accommodate a C99-ism in id.c."

	Suggestion from Eric Blake.

	Accommodate building on OS/2 (www.ecomstation.com Ecs v2 rc4)
	* configure.ac: Filter out carriage returns in more places.
	Reported by Elbert Pol, details here:

	guard against inserting a NEWS entry into a block for a prior release
	Without a guard like this, it is far too easy to apply a patch

	* tests/mkdir/perm: Use the function rather than sourcing the file.
	* tests/cp/cp-parents: Likewise.

	* maint.mk (sc_root_tests): Adapt rule to new syntax used
	in tests/Makefile.am.

	Revamp test-related Makefiles.
	One side-effect of this change is that "make check" now works even if
	you put "." early in your shell's search PATH (don't do that!).

	Remove all test-related Makefile.am files, except those generated
	by mk-script.  Instead, tests/Makefile.am now lists not only the
	tests directly under tests/, but also those in tests/*/ that are
	not generated by mk-script, e.g., cp/abuse, cp/acl, mv/i-1, etc.

	A lot of these changes are like this:

	* tests/Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Remove rwx-to-mode.
	(SUBDIRS): Remove each dir with a removed Makefile.am.
	(EXTRA_DIST): Add $(TESTS).
	(TESTS): Add over 300 entries.

	* tests/mkdir/selinux: Undo most of previous change,
	bc22dbbf844f31ddaf2e68b167d0128a985d73ab, and instead
	invoke the command via "nice".  Using "exec" should be

	Eric Blake suggested using nice.

	mknod --help: note that this command may be a shell built-in

	option to precede all others, to avoid a warning.

	* bootstrap: Remove dangling symlinks from lib (aka $source_base), too.

	Avoid root-only SELinux-related test failures w/o mcstransd.
	When mcstransd is not running (i.e., after service mcstrans stop),
	"make check" as root would provoke two test failures.
	* tests/cp/cp-a-selinux: Use the context, root:object_r:tmp_t:s0,
	that works both with and without mcstransd.
	Thanks to Eric Paris for the tip and to Ondřej Vašík for alerting

	paste -d\\: avoid heap overrun for backslash at end of delim list
	* src/paste.c: Include "quotearg.h".
	(collapse_escapes): Handle backslash-escaped backslash explicitly.
	Handle unescaped backslash at end of string by returning nonzero,
	rather than by overrunning memory.
	(main): Diagnose an invalid delimiter list -- carefully.
	Reported by Cristian Cadar, Daniel Dunbar and Dawson Engler.
	* tests/misc/paste-no-nl (delim-bs): Add a test to demonstrate the
	heap-smashing capability.
	(delim-bs2): Prior to coreutils-5.1.2, this bug was a little harder
	to demonstrate: it would corrupt a first-argument containing e.g., \b
	* NEWS: Mention the bug fix.

	portability: work around a "busybox sed" limitation
	* configure.ac: While every other sed tested supports usage like
	'/\(re\)/{s//\1/;...<NEWLINE>}', and POSIX appears to requires this,
	busybox's sed does not support it.  So duplicate the regexp:
	'/\(re\)/{s/\(re\)/\1/;...<NEWLINE>}'.  Reported by Vincent Lefevre:

2008-03-21  Ingo Weinhold  <ingo_weinhold@gmx.de>

	remove.c: Accommodate systems with negative errno values.
	* src/remove.c (cache_fstatat): Store errno value directly in
	the st_ino field, rather than trying to shoehorn it into st_size.
	This is required at least on BeOS and Haiku.

2008-03-21  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	* src/seq.c (long_double_format): Add a comment.

	* GNUmakefile: Update from gnulib.

2008-03-20  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	Remove today's automake kludge, altogether.  Fix properly.
	* man/Makefile.am: Use dist_man1_MANS instead of dist_man_MANS.
	Suggestion from Ralf Wildenhues.

	Add a check to detect this problem, in case it reappears.
	* maint.mk (my-distcheck): Run "make install", and then ensure
	that ls.1 is installed.

	Kludge to make automake generate install-man rules
	* man/Makefile.am (dist_man_MANS): Add a literal, rm.1.
	Without this, "make install" would not install man pages.
	However, with this kludge, the rm.1 man page is installed
	even when you configure with --enable-no-install-program=rm.

	Revert recent man/Makefile.am change.
	Revert 4b544e447eb78fd1f031a026a499f6aed177808a.
	* man/Makefile.am: That change was only a band-aid.  It solved
	the stated problem, but not a deeper one: that "make install"
	would no longer man pages.  Reported by Dmitry V. Levin.
	The latter problem arose in
	167b8025aca487de001da2448c1aebc2747bc1d3 with the removal of
	the sole literal from the definition of dist_man_MANS.  When
	automake perceives dist_man_MANS as empty, it no longer emits
	the install-man* rules.

2008-03-20  Eric Blake  <ebb9@byu.net>

	Sync GNUmakefile with gnulib.

	Remove more vestiges of CVS.

	(VC_LIST_EXCEPT): Rename from CVS_LIST_EXCEPT.

	mv: never unlink a destination file before calling rename
	While cp --preserve=links must unlink certain destination files,
	mv must never do that.
	* src/copy.c (copy_internal): Pull the '! x->move_mode' test "up",
	so it affects the entire condition, and not just DEREF_NEVER mode.
	Reported by James Ralston in <http://bugzilla.redhat.com/438076>.
	* tests/mv/atomic2: New file.  Test for the above fix.
	* tests/mv/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add atomic2.
	* NEWS: Mention the bug-fix.
	[Bug introduced in 367719ba5f1dbd5e2f7fa2466c441f23f66a7c9e]

	Autoconf will use this to override _autoreconf and to export PATH.
	(_autoreconf): Define.
	(_dummy): cd to $(srcdir) before removing autom4te.cache.

	* bootstrap: Sync from gnulib and remove part of a local kludge.

2008-03-10  Ondřej Vašík  <ovasik@redhat.com>

2008-03-05  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	Now that Makefile.maint is used in VPATH builds, too...
	* Makefile.maint (prev_version_file): Prefix with $(srcdir)/.
	(syntax-check-rules): Prefix $(ME) with $(srcdir)/.

	Avoid new "make distcheck" failure, now that VPATH has GNUmakefile.
	* GNUmakefile: Remove commands to create ".version".
	They were unnecessary, and caused creation of a newer .version
	file in a VPATH build, which in turn caused creation of updated
	man/*.1 files reflecting the newer time stamp on .version.
	Those *.1 files were not removed (since they're distributed), and
	the fact that they remained after "distclean" triggered the failure.

2008-03-04  Eric Blake  <ebb9@byu.net>

	Reinstate GNUmakefile patch, but with workaround for automake.
	* configure.ac (AC_CONFIG_LINKS): Use shell variable to bypass
	automake distclean rules.
	* Makefile.am (distclean-local): Clean GNUmakefile in VPATH builds,
	since we are bypassing automake.
	* GNUmakefile (_is-dist-target): 'distclean' is not a dist target.

2008-03-04  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	Clarify comment and attribute preceding change: Reported by Ralf Wildenhues.

	Comment out yesterday's VPATH-friendly addition, for now.
	* configure.ac: ...while we wait for a fixed version of automake.

2008-03-03  Eric Blake  <ebb9@byu.net>

	Use m4_PACKAGE_VERSION, not AC_AUTOCONF_VERSION.
	* configure.ac: The latter is only in post-2.61 autoconf.

	GNUmakefile build tweaks.
	* GNUmakefile: When Makefile is not present, make common targets depend
	on "all" in order to trigger nicer error message.
	* configure.ac: If autoconf is new enough, link GNUmakefile into VPATH
	builds.
	For more details, see
	<http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.gnu.core-utils.bugs/12853>.

2008-03-03  Simon Josefsson  <simon@josefsson.org>

	* GNUmakefile: Add $(srcdir)/ prefix to git-version-gen and argument.

2008-03-02  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	One more for non-srcdir "make dist".
	* GNUmakefile: Also cd $(srcdir) before running autoreconf.

	Adjust so that non-srcdir "make dist" works, too.
	* GNUmakefile: Add $(srcdir)/ prefix to git-version-gen and argument.

	Don't infringe namespace of "sub"-Makefiles.
	* GNUmakefile (_dummy, _have-Makefile): Add "_" prefix.

	Create sha256 and sha512 modules and move files into gl/.
	* bootstrap.conf (gnulib_modules): Add sha256 and sha512.

2008-03-01  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	Don't skip the groups-version test.
	* tests/Makefile.am (built_programs): Remove unused definition.
	* src/Makefile.am (built_programs.list): Print a space-separated
	list of program names, not NL-separated, since all clients now
	expect a space-separated list.

	Don't exempt "groups" from write-failure test, now that it's a C program.
	* tests/misc/help-version: Since groups is no longer a shell
	script, a buggy bourne shell can't cause trouble.

	* configure.ac (AC_INIT): Use .tarball-version, not .version.

	Don't depend on gnulib's deprecated "free" module.
	* bootstrap.conf (obsolete_gnulib_modules): Remove free.
	* gl/modules/mgetgroups (Depends-on): Remove free.

2008-02-28  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	Make copyright comments consistent.
	* src/mktemp.c: Update copyright to use newer form.

	Make first copyright lines consistent. Some did not end in ", Inc.".
	Due to that missing ", Inc" at end of line, emacs' copyright-updating
	code missed some opportunities.  This corrects most of those, and

	join: avoid new leaks
	* src/join.c (prevline): Make prevline module-level static, so that
	the allocated items can be freed at exit.
	(free_prevline): new atexit function; frees items in prevline[].
	Use ARRAY_CARDINALITY, so include "argmatch.h" to get that.
	(main): Arrange for free_prevline to be called during exit.
	(get_line): Free prevline[which - 1] also, as that
	will have been allocated by dup_line.

2008-02-20  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	Remove xdelta support, clean up distcheck process. * Makefile.maint (writable-files): Don't create $(release_archive_dir). (my-distcheck): Don't depend on prev-tgz. Remove xdelta-related variables and uses. (alpha beta major): Skip steps if $(release_archive_dir) doesn't exist.

	seq: give better diagnostics for invalid formats.
	* src/seq.c: (validate_format): New function.
	(main): Use it.
	* tests/misc/seq (fmt-d, fmt-e): Test for expected diagnostics with

	[jm: src/seq.c: make diagnostics more consistent
	 tests/misc/seq (fmt-eos1): adjust the expected diagnostic ]

2008-02-19  James Youngman  <jay@gnu.org>

	join: new options: --check-order and --nocheck-order.
	* src/join.c: Support --check-order and --nocheck-order.
	New variables check_input_order, seen_unpairable and
	issued_disorder_warning[]. For --check-order, verify that the
	input files are in sorted order.  For the default case, check the
	order only if there are unpairable lines.
	(join): Perform ordering checks after reaching EOF on either
	input.
	(usage): Mention --check-order and --nocheck-order.
	(dupline): Save a copy of the previously-read input line so that
	we can detect disorder on the input.
	(get_line): Temporarily save a copy of the previous line (by
	calling dupline) and check relative ordering (by calling
	checkorder) before returning the newly-read line.
	(getseq, join): Tell get_line which file we are reading from.
	(advance_seq): New function, factoring out some of the code
	commonly surrounding calls to getseq.
	(checkorder): New function.  Verifies that a pair of consecutive
	input lines are in sorted order.
	* doc/coreutils.texi (join invocation): Document the new options
	--check-order and --nocheck-order.
	* tests/join/Test.pm (tv): Added tests for --check-order and
	--nocheck-order.
	* NEWS: Mention this new feature.

	Fix non-srcdir "make distcheck" failure.
	* Makefile.am (check-ls-dircolors): Look for sources under
	$(srcdir), not under ".".

2008-02-18  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	seq: give a proper diagnostic for an invalid --format=% option
	* src/seq.c (long_double_format): Handle '%' at end of string.

	* NEWS: Mention this.
	Reported by Pádraig Brady.

2008-02-17  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	.gitignore, src/.gitignore: ignore more

	Clean up Makefile.maint.
	* Makefile.maint: Remove obsolete comments.
	(local-checks-available): Remove changelog-check.

	Clean up ls.c.
	* src/ls.c (put_indicator): Use fwrite, not a loop.

	Ensure that dircolors.c and ls.c remain in sync.
	* Makefile.am (check-ls-dircolors): New rule.
	(distcheck-hook): Depend on it.

	Expand "ls --color" tests to also use the dircolors defaults.
	* tests/misc/ls-misc: Adjust this test so each is run twice.  First, as usual,
	and the second time with LS_COLORS set using the default settings
	produced by running dircolors.
	* tests/Coreutils.pm: See below.

	This required some changes:
	  - save and restore $ENV{LS_COLORS} for each individual test
	  that requires a specific value.
	  - Since this is the first test to call the run_tests command more
	  than once, it has exposed that that function erroneously modifies
	  the \@Tests array.  Fix that in tests/Coreutils.pm.

	Adjust dircolors to match ls.c.
	* src/dircolors.hin: comment out NORMAL and FILE, define RESET.
	* src/dircolors.c (slack_codes) Add "RESET".
	(ls_codes): Add "rs".

2008-02-17  Ed Avis  <ed@membled.com>

	ls --color no longer outputs unnecessary escape sequences
	In --color mode, plain files do not get any color, not even white.
	When no highlighting is required, ls outputs no escape sequence at all.
	* src/ls.c (print_with_color):
	(used_color): New global.
	(indicator_no) [C_RESET]: New enum value.
	(indicator_name) ["rs"]: Corresponding new string.
	(color_indicator): Make the 'normal' and 'file' markers be NULL.
	Use "rs" (C_RESET) to reset to ordinary colors.
	(process_signals): Restore default colors only if necessary.
	(main): Don't call prep_non_filename_text here.
	(print_name_with_quoting): Call it here, instead.
	(prep_non_filename_text): Use C_RESET, not C_NORM.
	(print_color_indicator): Return bool, not void.
	Print nothing, when possible.
	(put_indicator): Call prep_non_filename_text the first time.
	* tests/misc/ls-misc: Test for above.
	* tests/ls/color-dtype-dir: Adapt: no escapes around regular file name.
	* TODO: Remove item.
	* NEWS: Mention this.

2008-02-17  Dan Jacobson  <jidanni@jidanni.org>

	Avoid tests/cp/acl test failure.

	to an absolute name, so it can be used from any point in the
	test hierarchy.  Reported by James Youngman.

2008-02-16  James Youngman  <jay@gnu.org>

	Use the gettime module in ls.c.
	Implement TODO list item to make ls.c use the gettime module.
	* TODO (ls): Now that we use gettime, remove the TODO entry.
	* src/ls.c: Use timespec.h and the gettime module.
	(current_time): Change type from time_t to struct timespec.
	(current_time_ns): Removed.
	(get_current_time): Removed.
	(print_long_format): Remove when and when_ns, since we have
	when_timespec anyway.  Change type of variable six_months_ago from
	time_t to struct timespec.

2008-02-14  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	groups: don't test printf and putchar calls for failure
	They are unnecessary, since we use gnulib's closeout module.
	* src/group-list.c (print_group): Remove explicit error tests.
	* src/groups.c (main): Likewise.
	(write_error): Remove function.

2008-02-13  James Youngman  <jay@gnu.org>

	Replace groups.sh with groups.c.
	* src/groups.c (main): New file, replacing groups.sh.
	* src/group-list.c, src/group-list.h: New files, factored out of id.c,
	implementing the functionality that "id" and "groups" have in common.
	* src/id.c (print_full_info): Avoid a segfault when trying to print
	an error message if getgroups fails.
	(print_group_list): Move to group-list.c.
	(print_group): Likewise.
	* man/Makefile.am: When building groups.1, obtain the help text
	from src/groups.c, not src/groups.sh.
	(noinst_HEADERS): Add group-list.h.
	(group): Remove rule.
	(dist_man_MANS): Remove groups.1.
	* doc/coreutils.texi (groups: Print group names a user is in):
	Explain why "groups" and "groups $(id -un)" give different results
	in existing login sessions after you change the group database.
	(id: Print user identity): Likewise for "id".
	* po/POTFILES.in: Add src/group-list.c and src/groups.c.
	* NEWS: mention this.
	* AUTHORS: Update.
