If the command times out, then exit with status 124.  Otherwise, exit
with the status of COMMAND.  If no signal is specified, send the TERM
signal upon timeout.  The TERM signal kills any process that does not
block or catch that signal.  For other processes, it may be necessary to
use the KILL (9) signal, since this signal cannot be caught.
