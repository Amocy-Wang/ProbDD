/* Convert BEG, an *N-byte string, to uppercase, and write the
   NUL-terminated result into malloc'd storage.  Upon success, set *N
   to the length (in bytes) of the resulting string (not including the
   trailing NUL byte), and return a pointer to the uppercase string.
   Upon memory allocation failure, exit.  *N must be positive.

   Although this function returns a pointer to malloc'd storage,
   the caller must not free it, since this function retains a pointer
   to the buffer and reuses it on any subsequent call.  As a consequence,
   this function is not thread-safe.

   When each character in the uppercase result string has the same length
   as the corresponding character in the input string, set *LEN_MAP_P
   to NULL.  Otherwise, set it to a malloc'd buffer (like the returned
   buffer, this must not be freed by caller) of the same length as the
   result string.  (*LEN_MAP_P)[J] is the change in byte-length of the
   character in BEG that formed byte J of the result as it was converted to
   uppercase.  It is usually zero.  For lowercase Turkish dotless I it
   is -1, since the lowercase input occupies two bytes, while the
   uppercase output occupies only one byte.  For lowercase I in the
   tr_TR.utf8 locale, it is 1 because the uppercase Turkish dotted I
   is one byte longer than the original.  When that happens, we have two
   or more slots in *LEN_MAP_P for each such character.  We store the
   difference in the first one and 0's in any remaining slots.

   This map is used by the caller to convert offset,length pairs that
   reference the uppercase result to numbers that refer to the matched
   part of the original buffer.  */
