	(scriptversion): New variable.
	Change initializations like `variable=""' to `variable='.
	(usage): New variable.
	Use `test', not `['.
	Use `test -z "$var"', not `[ x"$var" = x ]'.
	Use `test -n "$var"', not `[ x"$var" != x ]'.
	Alphabetize case entries.
	Accept --help and --version options.
	Remove unnecessary `else :' clauses.
	Add a `Local variables' eval block to help emacs users update

	Make it work even when names contain spaces or shell metachars.
	* install-sh: Write diagnostics to stderr, not stdout.
	Normalize spacing in diagnostics: use one space (not two, and not a TAB)
	after the leading `install:'.
	Add double quotes around `$src' here: $doit $instcmd "$src" "$dsttmp"

	Merge in some changes from the version in automake.
	* install-sh: Remove unnecessary quotes around `case' argument.
	Use `[ cond1 ] || [ cond2 ]' rather than `[ cond1 -o cond2 ]'.
	Use `:' rather than `true'.

2002-02-17  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* config.guess (main): Don't use `head -1'; it's no longer portable.
	Use `sed 1q' instead.
