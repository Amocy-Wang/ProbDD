	been copied.
     - when using -H and processing a command line argument;
	that command line argument could be a symlink pointing to another
	command line argument.  With `cp -H --preserve=link', we hard-link
	those two destination files.
     - likewise for -L except that it applies to all files, not just
	command line arguments.

     Also record directory dev/ino when using --recursive.  We'll use that
     info to detect this problem: cp -R dir dir.  FIXME-maybe: ideally,
     directory info would be recorded in a separate hash table, since
     such entries are useful only while a single command line hierarchy
