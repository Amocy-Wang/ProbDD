$0: this test requires that you be a member of more than one group,
but running \`id -nG' either failed or found just one.  If you really
are a member of at least two group, then rerun this test with FETISH_GROUPS
set in your environment to the space-separated list of names.  E.g.,

  env FETISH_GROUPS='users cdrom' make check
