2004-02-23  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* coreutils.texi (chown invocation): Document that chown now falls
	back on USER.GROUP parsing regardless of POSIX version, as POSIX

2004-01-19  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* coreutils.texi (Exit status): Document that ordinary failure
	might not exit with status 1 on unusual platforms.
	Mention chroot, env, nice, and su as having unusual exit
	status patterns.  Don't bother to mention true and false
	since their exit status patterns are actually normal.

	status pattern.
	(chroot invocation): Simplify description of exit status 1.
	Remove duplicate description of status 127.

	Adjust example 'ls' output to match new behavior with narrower
	output columns.
	(The cut command): Remove example that cut the output of
	'ls -l'.  The output was incorrect even with the old 'ls', and
	the whole idea of using 'cut' on 'ls -l' output is bogus anyway.

2003-11-24  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	Parse floating-point operands and options in the C locale.
	POSIX requires this for printf, and we might as well be
	consistent elsewhere (tail, sleep, seq).

2003-10-15  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

2003-09-29  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	Mention what happens if a line lacks enough fields or characters.

2003-05-13  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* coreutils.texi (true invocation): Mention that it is possible to
	make true --help or true --version (in non-POSIX mode) exit nonzero.
	Suggestion from Paul Eggert.

2003-05-10  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* coreutils.texi (Exit status): Remove `uniq' from the list.

	--dereference-command-line-symlink-to-dir.

2003-01-15  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	formatting): Undo last change.

2003-01-15  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	thousands-separators) and for explicit size suffixes on output.

	* coreutils.texi (Block size): Say that:
	This affects display format as well as block size.
	Fractional block counts are rounded up.

	A block size spec preceded by ' generates thousands separators.
	A suffix without a preceding integer generates suffixes.
	(tail invocation): 32k -> 32 KiB.
	(What information is listed): ls -h is now equivalent to

	* coreutils.texi (nohup invocation): Change behavior to conform to
	POSIX 1003.1-2001:
	  - Do not adjust scheduling priority.
	  - Redirects stderr to stdout, if stderr is not a terminal.
	  - Exit status is now 126 if command was found but not invoked,

2002-06-26  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	Uname option --release has been renamed to --kernel-release,
	and --sysname has been renamed to --kernel-name;
