#serial 9

dnl From Jim Meyering.
dnl
dnl See if the glibc *_unlocked I/O macros or functions are available.
dnl Use only those *_unlocked macros or functions that are declared
dnl (because some of them were declared in Solaris 2.5.1 but were removed
dnl in Solaris 2.6, whereas we want binaries built on Solaris 2.5.1 to run
dnl on Solaris 2.6).

AC_DEFUN([gl_FUNC_GLIBC_UNLOCKED_IO],
[
  dnl Persuade glibc and Solaris <stdio.h> to declare
  dnl fgets_unlocked(), fputs_unlocked() etc.
