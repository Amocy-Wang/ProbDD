2004-02-21  Sergey Poznyakoff  <gray@Mirddin.farlep.net>

	* src/create.c (dump_file0): The conditional at line
	1296 prevented incremental backups on individual files
	from working, as reported by Andreas Schuldei
	<andreas@schuldei.org>.

	This is due to the condition

	  (0 < top_level || !incremental_option)

	Removing it makes incremental backups work for individual
	files as well as for directories. On the other hand, it does
	not affect other functionality, as shown by the reasoning below:

	To begin with, the two parts of this condition are mutually
	superfluous, because

	  1) when top_level < 0, incremental_option == 1
	  so the condition yields false
	  2) when top_level >= 0, incremental_option == 0
	  so the condition yields true.

	In other words, it is completely equivalent to

	      (!incremental_option)

	Now, let's consider the effect of its removal. There are two cases:

	1) when incremental_option==1
	This means incremental backup in progress. In this case dump_file
	is invoked only for directories or for files marked with 'Y' by
	get_directory_contents. The latter are those that did not meet the
	condition in incremen.c:242, which is exactly the same condition
	as this at create.c:1296. So, for these files the check
	(!incremental_option) is useless, since the rest of the
	conditional will yield false anyway. On the other hand, if
	dump_file is invoked on a directory, the conditional will yield
	false due to !S_ISDIR assertion, so these will be processed as usual.

	Thus, for this case the extra condition (!incremental_option) is
	irrelevant, and its removal won't alter the behavior of tar,
	*except* that it will enable incremental backups on individual
	files, which is the wanted effect.

	2) when incremental_option==0
	In this case the condition yields true and its removal does not
	affect the functionality.

	* THANKS: Updated
	* configure.ac: Raised patchlevel to 93
	* src/incremen.c: Minor stylistic fixes.
	* tests/listed01.sh: New test. Check listed incremental

	set to POSIX (or reading subcommand is requested).

	* src/update.c (update_archive): Write global extended header if
	constructed.
	* src/xheader.c (xheader_format_name): Bugfix.

	* NEWS: Likewise.
	* src/create.c (to_chars): Added a comment.
	* src/tar.h: Comment to GNU_FORMAT

2004-02-18  Sergey Poznyakoff  <gray@Mirddin.farlep.net>

	* README: Updated
	* configure.ac: Added stpcpy

	* lib/Makefile.am: Likewise
	* src/common.h (xheader_xhdr_name,xheader_ghdr_name): New
	functions
	* src/create.c (write_extended): Call xheader_xhdr_name
	instead of using hardcoded "././@PaxHeader" name.

	Fix Debian bug 230872, originally reported by Jeff King in
	<http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=230872>.

	* doc/tar.texi (posix compliance): Remove.  The whole section
	was a misunderstanding of what POSIXLY_CORRECT is supposed to
	mean.  The GNU Coding Standards says that POSIXLY_CORRECT
	is for disabling extensions that are incompatible with POSIX:
	it is not for disabling compatible extensions.  All references
	to this section removed.
	(posix): This format is created only if the posix format is
	specified; it is no longer created if gnu format is specified
	and POSIXLY_CORRECT is set.
	* src/tar.c (decode_options): Ignore POSIXLY_CORRECT.
	POSIX does not specify the behavior of tar, so we should
	not worry about POSIXLY_CORRECT here.

2004-01-21  Sergey Poznyakoff  <gray@Mirddin.farlep.net>

	Synchronize with Gettext 0.13.1, Automake 1.8, Autoconf 2.59,
	and translation website.

	* bootstrap: Don't bother skipping codeset.m4, glibc21.m4,
	intdiv0.m4, inttypes_h.m4, inttypes.m4, inttypes-pri.m4,
	isc-posix.m4, and lcmessage.m4 from gnulib.  This list of files is
	a bit obsolete anyway, now that gettext 0.13.1 is out.  Also, the
	files are replaced by autoreconf.  Also, there seems to be a bug
	in gettext/autoconf/automake if we try to omit these files after
	autoreconf has replaced them, even though the gettext manual says
	they're optional.  So give up and just include them for now, even
	though they make 'configure' longer and slower.

	Change translation URL from
	<http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/contrib/po/maint/tar/> to
	<http://www2.iro.umontreal.ca/~gnutra/po/maint/tar/> to
	accommodate translator website revamp.

	Fail if autoreconf fails.

	* m4/.cvsignore: Add intmax.m4, longdouble.m4, printf-posix.m4,
	signed.m4, size_max.m4, wchar_t.m4, wint_t.m4, xsize.m4, to
	ignore files now supplied by gettext 0.13.1.

2001-09-26  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* NEWS, configure.ac (AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE): Version 1.13.25.

	* src/buffer.c (flush_read): Don't diagnose partial blocks before
	end of file; just ignore them silently.

	* src/list.c (read_header): Don't keep around extended name
	and link info indefinitely; keep it only for the next file.
	This fixes a bug introduced in 1.13.24, and removes the need
	for some static variables.  Set recent_long_name and
	recent_long_link to zero if there were no long links; this
	avoids a violation of ANSI C rules for pointers in delete.c.
	* THANKS: Add Christian Laubscher.

	have their own, conflicting declaration of strtoimax in sys/inttypes.h.

	taking an extra stat ourselves.  All callers changed.
	(set_stat): Likewise.
	(apply_nonancestor_delayed_set_stat): New arg 'after_symlinks'.
	If false, stop when encountering a struct whose 'after_symlinks'
	member is true.  Otherwise, go through all structures but check
	them more carefully.  All callers changed.

	file, otherwise define.

	* src/misc.c:
	(is_dot_or_dotdot, closedir_error, closedir_warn, opendir_error,
	opendir_warn, readdir_error): Remove; no longer needed.
	(safer_rmdir): Strip leading ./ (or .// or ./// or ././ or etc.)
	before deciding whether we're trying to remove ".".
	(remove_any_file): Try unlink first if we are not root.  Use
	savedir when recursively removing directories, to avoid exhausting
	file descriptors.
	(savedir_error, savedir_warn, symlink_error): New functions.

	* src/list.c: (read_and): Do not invoke
	apply_nonancestor_delayed_set_stat; DO_SOMETHING is now
	responsible for that.  Do not invoke apply_delayed_set_stat; our
	caller is now responsible for that.
	(read_header): Use signed char instead of signed_char.  Prevent
	later references to current_header from mistakenly treating it as
	an old GNU header.
	(from_header): Quote invalid base-64 strings in diagnostics.
	(time_from_header): Do not warn about future timestamps in
	archive; check_time now does that.
	(print_header): Quote unknown file types.
	(skip_member): New function, replacing skip_extended_headers and
	now skipping the whole member instead of just the extended
	headers.  All callers changed.  This makes the code handle
	extended headers uniformly, and fixes some bugs.

	* src/update.c (update_archive): Use skip_member.

	* src/extract.c (we_are_root): Now global.
	(struct delayed_symlink): New type.
	(delayed_symlink_head): New var.
	(extr_init, fatal_exit): Invoke extract_finish on fatal errors,
	not apply_delayed_set_stat.
	(set_mode, set_stat): Pointer args are now const pointers.
	(check_time): New function.
	(set_stat): Warn if setting a file's timestamp to be the future.
	(make_directories): Do not save and restore errno.
	(maybe_recoverable): Set errno to ENOENT if we cannot make missing
	intermediate directories.
	(extract_archive): Invoke apply_nonancestor_delayed_set_stat here,
	not in caller.  Extract potentially dangerous symbolic links more
	carefully, deferring their creation until the end, and using a
	regular file placeholder in the meantime.  Do not remove trailing
	/ and /. from file names.  Do not bother checking for ".." when
	checking whether a directory loops back on itself, as loopbacks
	can occur with symlinks too.  Also, in that case, do not bother
	saving and restoring errno; just set it to EEXIST.
	(apply_nonancestor_delayed_set_stat): A prefix is a potential
	ancestor if it ends in slash too (as well as ending in a char just
	before slash).
	(apply_delayed_set_stat): Remove.
	(apply_delayed_symlinks, extract_finish): New functions.

	* doc/fdl.texi: New file.
	* doc/Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Add fdl.texi.
	($(srcdir)/tar.info): Add fdl.texi.  Invoke makeinfo with --no-split.
	* doc/tar.texi: Add Free Documentation License.  New section
	"Overwrite Old Files", and revamp that section to make it easier to
	follow.  "tar" -> "GNU tar" where appropriate.  Migrate getdate
	documentation into getdate.texi.  Fix several minor typos.  Describe
	TAR_OPTIONS.  Describe incompatibility between incremental backups and
	--atime-preserve.  Describe incompatibility between --verify and other
	options.  Mention that tar normally removes symbolic links rather than
	following them, when extracting a file of the same name.

	* THANKS: Add gpoul.  Change skip's address.

	* po/POTFILES.in: Add lib/human.c.

	* src/common.h (namelist, namelast): Remove decls.
	(we_are_root, extract_finish, skip_member, savedir_error,
	savedir_warn, symlink_error, gnu_list_name): New decls.
	(apply_delayed_set_stat, apply_nonancestor_delayed_set_stat,
	skip_extended_headers, is_dot_or_dotdot, closedir_error,
	closedir_warn, opendir_error, opendir_warn, readdir_error,
	readdir_warn): Remove decls.
	(get_directory_contents): New off_t arg.
	(addname): Now returns struct name *.

	* src/tar.h, tests/genfile.c: Fix comments.

	* src/create.c: Include hash.h.
	(gnu_list_name): Remove decl.
	(struct link): Remove "next" member.
	(linklist): Remove.
	(start_header): Say "leading `FOO'" rather than "`FOO' prefix" for
	consistency with other diagnostics.
	(deal_with_sparse): Check for I/O error when closing the file.
	(create_archive): Do not allocate an array of size PATH_MAX, as
	PATH_MAX might be (size_t) -1.  Instead, allocate an array with
	the size that's needed.
	(hash_link, compare_links): New functions.
	(dump_file): Do not exhaust open file descriptors when descending
	deeply into a directory, by using savedir rather than
	opendir/readdir.  Do not zero-fill the name buffer unnecessarily.
	Hash the set of links already created, instead of using a linked
	list.  Fix some bugs in outputting sparse files which caused the
	sparse tables to be incorrect.  When a file unexpectedly shrinks,
	output zeros rather than garbage.  Do not allocate an array of
	size PATH_MAX, as PATH_MAX might be (size_t) -1.  Instead,
	allocate an array with the size that's needed.

	* src/incremen.c: Include hash.h.
	(struct directory): Remove "next", "dir_text".  Change "name" to
	be char[1] with struct hack, not const char *.  Add "found".
	(directory_list): Remove.  Replaced by directory_table.
	(directory_table): New var.
	(nfs_string): Renamed from nfs.
	(hash_directory, compare_directories): New functions.
	(note_directory): Now returns struct directory *.  First arg is
	now const pointer.  struct stat arg is now dev_t, ino_t, nfs.
	Remove text arg.  New "found" arg, basically corresponding to the
	old text arg not being null.  All callers changed.
	(note_directory, find_directory): Use hash table rather than
	linked list.
	(get_directory_contents): New arg "device".  Use savedir to do the
	hard work.  Save the nfs-ness of stat_data, since it might change
	under us.  Use note_directory instead of find_directory to save
	some work.  When adding an "A" record, do it with
	add_to_accumulator instead of cheating with strcat.
	(read_directory_file): Use "+" flag before device to indicate
	whether it was NFS.  Fix typo in checking for strtoul error.
	(write_directory_file_entry): New function.
	(write_directory_file): Use it, and use the hash routines to
	traverse the directory table.
	(gnu_restore): Use savedir rather than opendir/readdir.

	* src/tar.c: Include localedir.h, prepargs.h.
	(long_options): Now static.
	(long_options, usage, decode_options): -j is now short for
	--bzip2, and -I is now an alias for -T.
	(decode_options, main): argv is not const pointer now.
	(decode_options): Invoke prepend_default_options to support
	TAR_OPTIONS.  In diagnostic, mention the string that was the
	invalid blocking factor, tape length, group, owner, or record
	size.  --delete is no longer incompatible with -f -, undoing
	2000-01-07 change.
	(main): Invoke extract_finish at end of extraction.

	* src/rmt.c: Include localedir.h.
	(main): Update copyright date to 2000.

	* doc/getdate.texi: New file, taken from fileutils 4.0.27, with the
	following changes: Use @sc where appropriate.  Document the ranges of
	supported times more precisely.  Add Eggert to getdate authors.
	Document old Latin 12m/12pm tradition.  Remove list of alphabetic time
	zone names, as it wasn't correct and people shouldn't be relying on it
	anyway.  Relative items also account for non-DST adjustments.  Fix
	some misspellings.

	* lib/prepargs.c, lib/prepargs.h, tests/extrac04.sh: New file.

	* tests/ignfail.sh: opendir -> savedir in diagnostics.

	* tests/preset.in: Set LANGUAGE to the empty string, for some
	brain damaged host.

2000-10-20  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* m4/fnmatch.m4: Mention the GNU C library.

2000-10-19  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	glibc 2.1.95.

2000-10-17  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* lib/human.c (<limits.h>): Do not include; human.h does it if needed.
	(CHAR_BIT): Remove.

	* lib/human.h (<limits.h>): Include if HAVE_LIMITS_H.
	(CHAR_BIT): Define if not defined.

2000-09-09  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* lib/quotearg.c: From fileutils: rename ISASCII to IN_CTYPE_DOMAIN.

2000-08-07  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* lib/xmalloc.c: Memory exhausted -> memory exhausted

	* lib/xalloc.h (xalloc_msg_memory_exhausted):
	change to array from char *.

2000-08-06  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* m4/mbstate_t.m4: Define mbstate_t to be int, not char, for
	compatibility with glibc 2.1.3 strftime.c.

2000-07-31  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* lib/quotearg.c (quotearg_n_options):
	Don't make the initial slot vector a constant,
	since it might get modified.

	* lib/quotearg.c: Add support for more than one preallocated slot.

2000-07-30  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* lib/quotearg.c (quotearg_n_options):
	Preallocate a slot 0 buffer, so that the caller
	can always quote one small component of a "memory exhausted" message
	in slot 0.

2000-07-23  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* lib/quotearg.c:
	Include <wchar.h> even if ! (HAVE_MBRTOWC && 1 < MB_LEN_MAX), so that
	mbstate_t is always defined.

	Do not inspect MB_LEN_MAX, since it's incorrectly defined to be 1 in
	some GCC installations, and this configuration error is likely to be
	common.

2000-07-22  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* lib/quotearg.c:
	When the system forces us to redefine mbstate_t, shadow its mbsinit
	function.  From Bruno Haible.

2000-07-14  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* lib/xmalloc.c: Simplify exhausted message.

	New constant clocale_quoting_style.

	* lib/quotearg.c:
	(quoting_style_args, quoting_style_vals, quotearg_buffer_restyled):
	Add support for clocale_quoting_style, undoing previous change to
	locale_quoting_style.

2000-07-10  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* lib/quotearg.c:
	<wchar.h>: Include only if HAVE_MBRTOWC && 1 < MB_LEN_MAX,
	since otherwise we don't need it.
	(MB_CUR_MAX): Redefine to 1 if ! (HAVE_MBRTOWC && 1 < MB_LEN_MAX),
	since we don't do multibytes in that case.
	(quotearg_buffer_restyled): If a unibyte locale, don't bother to
	invoke multibyte primitives.

	* m4/mbstate_t.m4 (AC_MBSTATE_T):
	Renamed from AC_MBSTATE_T_OBJECT.  All uses changed.
	Change from a two-part test, which defines both HAVE_MBSTATE_T_OBJECT
	and mbstate_t, to a single-part test that simply defines mbstate_t.

	* lib/quotearg.c (mbrtowc): Do not use HAVE_WCHAR_H in the definition.
	Use defined mbstate_t, not HAVE_MBSTATE_T_OBJECT,
	to decide whether to define the BeOS workaround macro;
	this adjusts to the change to AC_MBSTATE_T.

	* m4/strerror_r.m4: New file.

2000-07-05  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* lib/quotearg.c: Use double-quote to quote.

	* lib/quotearg.c (N_): New macro.
	(gettext_default): New function.
	(quotearg_buffer_restyled): Use gettext_default ("{LEFT QUOTATION MARK}",
	"\"") for left quote, and gettext_default ("{RIGHT QUOTATION MARK}", "\"")
	for right quote.

	* lib/quotearg.c (struct quoting_options):
	Simplify quote_these_too dimension.
	From Bruno Haible  <haible@clisp.cons.org>.

	* m4/mbstate_t.m4 (AC_MBSTATE_T_OBJECT):
	Test for mbstate_t only if the test
	for an object-type mbstate_t fails.

	* lib/quotearg.c (mbrtowc): Declare returned type, since BeOS doesn't.

2000-07-03  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* m4/mbstate_t.m4 (AC_MBSTATE_T_OBJECT): Port to autoconf 2.13.
	Add AC_CHECK_HEADERS(stdlib.h), since we use HAVE_STDLIB_H.

	* lib/quotearg.c (mbrtowc):
	Assign to *pwc, and return 1 only if result is nonzero.
	(iswprint): Define to ISPRINT if we are substituting our own mbrtowc.

2000-07-02  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* lib/quotearg.c (mbstate_t):
	Do not define; it should be defined with AC_CHECK_TYPE.

2000-06-26  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* m4/mbstate_t.m4: Include stdio.h before wchar.h, to work around
	a bug in glibc 2.1.3.

	* lib/xmalloc.c: Fix inaccorate comment for xrealloc.

2000-06-19  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* lib/quotearg.c (ISASCII): Add #undef and move definition to follow
	inclusion of wctype.h to work around solaris2.6 namespace pollution.

	Reported by Tom Tromey.

2000-06-15  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* lib/human.c (adjust_value): New function.

	From Jim Meyering.

2000-06-14  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* lib/human.c (human_readable_inexact): Allow an input block size
	that is not a multiple of the output block size, and vice versa.

	* lib/getdate.y (get_date): Apply relative times after time zone
	indicator, not before.

2000-05-31  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* m4/largefile.m4: Rewrite so that we don't need to run getconf,
	and thus don't need AC_CANONICAL_HOST.

	(AC_SYS_LARGEFILE_FLAGS, AC_SYS_LARGEFILE_SPACE_APPEND): Remove.
	(AC_SYS_LARGEFILE_TEST_INCLUDES): New macro.
	(AC_SYS_LARGEFILE_MACRO_VALUE): Change arguments from
	CODE-TO-SET-DEFAULT to VALUE, INCLUDES, FUNCTION-BODY.  All uses
	changed.  Instead of inspecting the output of getconf, try to
	compile the test program without and with the macro definition.
	(AC_SYS_LARGEFILE): Do not require AC_CANONICAL_HOST or check for
	getconf.  Instead, check for the needed flags by compiling test
	programs.

	* configure.in (AC_CANONICAL_HOST): Remove; the largefile stuff no
	longer needs it.
	* config.guess, config.sub: Remove these files, for similar reasons.

2000-05-03  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* m4/largefile.m4 (AC_SYS_LARGEFILE): Define _XOPEN_SOURCE to be
	500, instead of _GNU_SOURCE to be 1, to work around glibc 2.1.3
	bug.  This avoids a clash when files like regex.c that define
	_GNU_SOURCE.

2000-05-02  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* m4/largefile.m4 (AC_SYS_LARGEFILE):
	Define _GNU_SOURCE if this is needed to make
	ftello visible (e.g. glibc 2.1.3).  Use compile-time test, rather than
	inspecting host and OS, to decide whether to define _LARGEFILE_SOURCE.

	* lib/quotearg.c (mbrtowc, mbstat_t):
	Add definitions if !HAVE_MBSTATE_T_OBJECT.
	(<wctype.h>): Include if HAVE_WCTYPE_H.

	members.
	(tID): Removed; not used.
	(tDAY, tDAY_UNIT, tDAYZONE, tHOUR_UNIT, tID, tLOCAL_ZONE,
	tMERIDIAN, tMINUTE_UNIT, tMONTH, tMONTH_UNIT tSEC_UNIT, tSNUMBER,
	tUNUMBER, tYEAR_UNIT, tZONE, o_merid): Now of type <intval>.
	(tSNUMBER, tUNUMBER): Now of type <textintval>.
	(date, number, to_year): Use width of number in digits, not its
	value, to determine whether it's a 2-digit year, or a 2-digit
	time.
	(yylex): Store number of digits of numeric tokens.  Return '?' for
	unknown identifiers, rather than (unused) tID.

2000-01-16  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* lib/quotearg.c (quotearg_buffer_restyled):
	Do not quote alert, backslash, formfeed,
	and vertical tab unnecessarily in shell quoting style.

2000-01-15  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* m4/c-bs-a.m4:
	Change quoting to be compatible with future autoconf versions.

2000-01-11  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* lib/exclude.c (FILESYSTEM_PREFIX_LEN, ISSLASH): Remove unused macros.

	* tests/preset.in:
	Set LC_ALL rather than LANGUAGE, LANG, and LC_MESSAGES.

	* tests/ignfail.sh (err): Adjust to new quoting scheme.

	* tests/delete02.sh: Fix typo: need to list archive2, not archive.

	* tests/extrac03.sh: Use -P option, so that .. doesn't get diagnosed.

	* src/tar.c ("quotearg.h"): New include.
	(usage): Now has __attribute__ ((noreturn)).

	mishandled.

	* src/misc.c (<quotearg.h>): New include.
	(quote_copy_string): Quote only newline and backslash; the output is no
	longer meant for humans, and is locale-independent.
	(contains_dot_dot): New function.
	(remove_any_file): Don't use lstat; just rmdir the file and then use
	unlink if the rmdir fails because the file isn't a directory.
	Check for readdir and closedir errors.
	(maybe_backup_file): Report "stat" for stat errors.
	(maybe_backup_file, chdir_do):

	opendir_warn, read_error, read_fatal, readdir_error, readdir_warn,
	readlink_error, readlink_warn, seek_error, seek_warn, stat_error,
	stat_warn, truncate_error, truncate_warn, unlink_error, waitpid_error,
	write_error, write_fatal, xfork, xpipe, quote_n, quote): New functions.

	* src/system.h (__attribute__): New macro.
	(O_NDELAY, O_NONBLOCK, O_APPEND): Remove.
	(S_ISDOOR): New macro.
	(closedir): New macro, if CLOSEDIR_VOID.

	* src/rmt.c, src/rtapelib.c (decode_oflag):

	* src/extract.c (<quotearg.h>): New include.
	(enum permstatus): New enum.
	(struct delayed_set_stat): file_name is now at end of buffer, to avoid
	two mallocs.  New members file_name_len, invert_permissions, permstatus.
	(extr_init): Remove hack that silently adjusted newdir_umask.
	(set_mode, set_stat): New args invert_permissions, permstatus, typeflag.
	Use these args to decide whether and how to set modes.
	(set_mode, set_stat, prepare_to_extract, extract_sparse_file, extract_archive):

	(maybe_recoverable): New parameter interdir_made.
	Add support for --overwrite.
	(extract_sparse_file, extract_archive):
	Quote arbitrary strings in diagnostics.
	(extract_archive): By default, warn about ".." in member names, and skip them.
	Don't open files with O_NONBLOCK or O_APPEND.
	Open with O_TRUNC only if --overwrite; otherwise, use O_EXCL to avoid
	overwriting them.  Pass only rwxrwxrwx permissions to `open' and `mkdir',
	minus the current umask.  Keep track of intermediate directories made,
	to avoid looping when making x/../x when x doesn't exist; the
	earlier code solved this in a different way that didn't fit well
	into the new scheme.  Don't extract permissions onto existing
	directories unless --overwrite is given.  Do not add -wx------
	permissions to new directories permanently; just do it temporarily.
	Remove no-longer-needed hack with MSDOS and directory time stamps.
	(apply_delayed_set_stat): New argument specifies which directories to
	fix statuses of.  Do not wait until the end of extraction to fix
	statuses; instead, fix a directory's status once we exit that directory.

	Don't assume that gettext preserves errno.

	* src/create.c (<quotearg.h>): New include.
	(start_header): Use `member names' to refer to archive member names, not
	`archive names'.  Warn about `..' in member names.
	(finish_sparse_file, dump_file):
	Quote arbitrary strings in diagnostics.
	(finish_sparse_file, dump_file):
	Don't assume that gettext preserves errno.
	(dump_file): Don't use `access' to determine whether a directory is readable;
	this isn't reliable if tar is setuid.  Use `opendir' instead.
	Check for readdir and closedir failures.
	Don't dump sockets as if they were fifos; just warn and skip.

	* src/delete.c (move_archive):
	Don't report fatal error merely because sizes don't fit
	into struct mtop values; fall back on lseek instead.
	Say `Cannot' uniformly, instead of `Could not' sometimes and `Cannot' others.
	Say `reposition' instead of `re-position'.
	(delete_archive_members):
	Set archive to STDOUT_FILENO before outputting trailing buffer.

	(enum old files): New enum.
	(old_files_option): New variable, replacing keep_old_files_option and
	unlink_first_option.
	(apply_delayed_set_stat): Now takes char const * param.
	(fatal_exit, contains_dot_dot, chdir_fatal, close_error,
	closedir_error, exec_fatal, mkfifo_error, mknod_error, open_error,
	open_fatal, open_warn, opendir_error, opendir_warn, read_error,
	read_fatal, readdir_error, readdir_warn, readlink_error,
	readlink_warn, seek_error, seek_warn, stat_error, stat_warn,
	truncate_error, truncate_warn, unlink_error, waitpid_error,
	write_error, write_fatal, xfork, xpipe, quote, quote_n): New decls.

	* src/buffer.c:
	(xclose, xdup2, child_open_for_compress, child_open_for_uncompress,
	archive_write_error, archive_read_error, flush_archive, close_archive,
	init_volume_number, new_volume):
	Don't assume that gettext preserves errno.

	(xdup2): Don't report errno if dup returns an unexpected nonnegative value.
	(open_archive): Reject multivolume verify attempts a bit earlier.
	Rename local variable `access', in case it's defined by system header.

	`Could not' sometimes and `Cannot' others.

	(open_archive, flush_read, flush_archive, close_archive, new_volume):
	Quote arbitrary strings in diagnostics.

	(read_error): Set archive to STDOUT_FILENO temporarily when writing
	archive buffer.

	(init_volume_number): Check for input and output errors in volno_file.

	(new_volume): Use new fatal_exit function to exit, and new xfork
	function to fork.

	* m4/Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Add c-bs-a.m4.

	* Makefile.am (ACINCLUDE_INPUTS): Add $(M4DIR)/c-bs-a.m4.

	* NEWS, configure.in (AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE): Version 1.13.15.

	* src/compare.c (diff_archive):
	Do not set errno to EPIPE; we no longer use perror.

	* src/create.c (dump_file):
	If a parent directory said that a file should be there but it is
	absent, diagnose it as being removed in the meantime.
	Do not pass meaningless errno to ERROR when reporting that the
	file changed as we read it.
	Report that a file changed if its ctime changes; this is more
	sensitive than mtime+size, and more accurate.

	* src/incremen.c (enum children): New type.
	(struct directory): Change old char allnew member to new enum children
	children member.
	All uses changed.
	(get_directory_contents): When doing an incremental dump that does
	not cross filesystem boundaries, dump the mount points, even though
	they are in a different filesystem.  This is for convenience when
	restoring, and for consistency with non-incremental dumps.
	This requires a 3-way flag for keeping track of which children we want,
	so we use enum children rather than boolean.

	* src/open3.c (modes): Remove.
	(open3): Remove unportable assumptions about flag encodings.
	Use `stat' instead of `access' for testing file existence,
	to avoid problems with setuid programs.

	Instead, always link fnmatch.h to some file, even if it's a throwaway.

1999-11-19  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* m4/largefile.m4: Update serial.

1999-10-03  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* lib/getdate.y (__attribute__):
	Don't use if GCC claims to be before 2.8; this is
	needed for OPENStep 4.2 cc.  Also, don't use if strict ANSI.

1999-09-25  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* lib/fnmatch.c, lib/fnmatch.hin: Merge changes from latest glibc.

	* src/names.c (name_next): Go back to using plain chdir.
	(name_gather): Use chdir_arg to keep track of arguments to chdir.

	as getting time can cause duplicate diagnostics if bogus.
	Remove "Hmm, " from diagnostic.
	Use "Skipping to next header" uniformly.
	(from_header): Renamed from from_chars.  All uses changed.
	Allow different forms for unportable 2's complement numbers.
	Don't check for extended forms when parsing checksums.
	Parse base-256 output.

	(mode_to_chars): Don't use two's complement in GNU format or POSIX

1999-03-01  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* acinclude.m4 (AM_WITH_NLS):
	Update to latest gettext version (serial 5).
	(AC_LFS_FLAGS): New macro
	(AC_LFS): Use it.  Append to CFLAGS, LDFLAGS, LDLIBS instead of
	working only with unset variables.  Append to CFLAGS, not CPPFLAGS.
	Work properly in cross-compilation scenario, by checking for getconf
	with AC_CHECK_TOOL and by ditching uname in favor of
	AC_CANONICAL_HOST and $host_os.  Add --disable-lfs option.

	* lib/getdate.y: Update to fileutils 4.0 getdate.y, with one patch:
	replace FORCE_ALLOCA_H with HAVE_ALLOCA_H.
	* lib/Makefile.am (AUTOMAKE_OPTIONS): Append ../src/ansi2knr,
