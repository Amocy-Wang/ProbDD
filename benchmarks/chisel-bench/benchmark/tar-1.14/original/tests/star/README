This directory contains scripts for testing GNU tar using
star "test archives". The archives themselves may be obtained
from http://download.berlios.de/pub/star/testscripts.

The tests are ignored unless environment variable STAR_TESTSCRIPTS
is set and points to the directory where the test archives reside.
Sample usage:

	make STAR_TESTSCRIPTS=testdir check

The following is a short description of the tests:

* gtarfail.sh and gtarfile2.tar

These tests require gtarfile.tar and gtarfile2.tar, respectively.
These files are POSIX compliant tar archives that were not accepted
by previous versions of GNU tar.

* multi-fail.sh

Requires gnu-multi-fail-volume1.gtar and gnu-multi-fail-volume2.gtar.
These are two parts of a multi-volume archive that previous versions
of tar refused to read (at least, without -B option). 

* ustar-big-2g.sh

Requires ustar-big-2g.tar.bz2. It is a tar archive containing a file with
the largest size that a historic tar implementation is able to understand.

* ustar-big-8g.sh

Requires ustar-big-8g.tar.bz2. This is a test for reading an archive containing
files with the largest size that may be used with ustar (POSIX.1-1990)
format.

* pax-big-10g.sh

Requires pax-big-10g.tar.bz2. It tests handling pax (POSIX.1-2001) archves
containing very large files (in this case -- 10 GB).

* qucktest.sh

A test for compliance to POSIX.1-1990 tar specification. It requires
the files ustar-all-quicktest.tar and quicktest.filelist. Apart
from them, the `tartest' program from 'star' package is needed.
The test may be run only with root privileges, so it is a good
idea to test the contents of ustar-all-quicktest.tar before running
it.
