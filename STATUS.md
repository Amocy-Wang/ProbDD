We would like to apply for **the functional badge**, **the Reusable badge**, and **the Artifacts Available badge**. We believe that the artifact deserves the badges for the following reasons.
- We carefully document the artifact about the tools used in our paper and the code about ProbDD. More details can be found [here](README.md).
- We provide a Docker Image in the artifact. After entering the container, it's covenient to verify and validate our work by using the provided scripts. We provide the source code in the artifact for manul installation as well. To build from source, the requirements and theinstallation guidance can be found [here](REQUIREMENTS) and [here](INSTALL), respectively.
- We provide an implementation of ProbDD that can be used for delta debugging tasks beyond the evaluation dataset. When a set of elements and a test function is provided, it reduces the elements to a smaller set. More details can be found [here](README.md).
- We place the artifact on a publicly accessible archival repository (this repo).
